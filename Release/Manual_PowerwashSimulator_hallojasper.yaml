# Q. What are the progression items and their order?
# A. Progressive items:
#        Progressive Nozzles for each power washer: white, green, yellow, red, turbo, triple tip in that order
#        Progressive Extensions for each power washer: short, long, extra long
#        Stepstool (can still be moved out of the way, just not used to gain height)
#        Progressive ladder: base length, halfway extended, fully extended
#        Scaffolding Floors (Allows you to go up that many floors on a scaffolding)
#        Completion Stars (70 stars to goal in Parts Mode, 35 to goal in Percentage Mode)
# 
# Q. How do I know where to clean?
# A. For Parts Mode:
#        Level Part Unlocks: Allows cleaning of various parts in levels.
#        All Locations show which "Level Part Unlock" is required for that location by the name between *
#        Example: the location "Back Garden Stepping Stones *Patio*" requires the "Back Garden Patio" item.
#        A few locations also have a number, this is for the few locations for which that part name appears that many times in the in game parts list, all have to be cleaned for the check.
#    For Percentage Mode:
#        Level Unlocks: Allows cleaning that level.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.
name: Player{number}

# Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files.
